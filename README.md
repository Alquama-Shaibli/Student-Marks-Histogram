# Student-Marks-Histogram
# Summary: 
This project involves creating a histogram using matplotlib in Python to visualize how student 
marks are distributed across defined ranges. It helps educators and students interpret 
performance levels through clear graphical representation. 
# Description: 
• Collect or load a list of student marks 

• Use pandas or direct Python lists to store the marks 

• Use matplotlib to create a histogram with appropriate bins 

• Add X-axis and Y-axis labels, title, and grid lines 

• Save the chart for presentation or reporting purposes 

# Functional Components: 
• Input: list of student marks 

• Use of plt.hist() to plot the histogram 

• Configure bin ranges (e.g., 0–10, 11–20, ..., 91–100) 

• Label axes with “Marks Range” and “Number of Students” 

• Add chart title and grid 

• Optionally save the plot as an image file
